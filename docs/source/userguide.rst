A user guide or user's guide, also commonly known as a manual, is a technical communication document intended to give assistance to people 
using a particular system.[1] It is usually written by a technical writer, although user guides are written by programmers, product or project managers, 
or other technical staff, particularly in smaller companies.[2]

User guides are most commonly associated with electronic goods, computer hardware and software.[3]

Most user guides contain both a written guide and the associated images. In the case of computer applications, it is usual to 
include screenshots of the human-machine interface(s), and hardware manuals often include clear, simplified diagrams. The language used is matched to the 
intended audience, with jargon kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly.
